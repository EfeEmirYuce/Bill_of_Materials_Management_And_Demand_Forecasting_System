# 🧩 Bill of Materials (BOM) & Demand Forecasting System

This project is a web-based application designed to manage product recipes (Bill of Materials) and optimize inventory planning using demand forecasting. It is especially useful for manufacturing industries that work with raw materials, semi-finished products, and multi-level product structures.

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 **Multi-Level BOM Creation**  
  Easily define final products, semi-finished goods, and raw materials in a tree-structured hierarchy.

- 🛠️ **Product Recipe Management**  
  Create and manage product recipes by selecting components and quantities from a predefined materials list.

- 📊 **Demand Forecasting (SARIMA)**  
  Forecast future product demand and automatically calculate the required quantities of raw materials.

- 🌐 **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Intuitive UI to help users create and visualize complex BOM structures — including drag-and-drop support (planned).

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Forecasting Model:** SARIMA (using statsmodels)
